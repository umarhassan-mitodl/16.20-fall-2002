Although it is possible to follow the course by using the extensive class notes and any additional notes taken by students, it is suggested that students learn to refer to alternate sources. In many cases, a different presentation may spark or enhance understanding. Thus, the following list of books is provided to serve this purpose. Specific readings from some of these books are recommended for the units taught in this course and are noted in the syllabus and unit notes. Furthermore, these books serve as more permanent and referencable material than class notes.

The first text (Rivello) has been a primary text but is now unfortunately out of publication. Copies of it will be on reserve in the Aero/Astro library. The second text (Timoshenko and Goodier) is a (the?) classic text on elasticity with lots of examples. A few copies may be available if people are interested. The third text is a relatively new text which helps to reinforce many of the ideas taught in 16.20 and is now a primary text. Copies of such can be purchased and a group purchase can be arranged if there is sufficient interest. The other eight texts (4-11) are good background references and reading assignments will be given in these (as background) from time to time. Text 11 is particularly pertinent as general background for Section VI on "Structural Dynamics." All texts are also on reserve in the Aero/Astro Library. In addition, Barker has an extensive set of references on structural mechanics including these texts. You are encouraged to seek out additional reading material to supplement lectures and reading assignments from the primary texts. In addition, the two books from the Materials & Structures section of Unified are good sources for information, particularly in reviewing material learnt in Unified.

Please note that most of the texts (except for No. 7) deal almost exclusively with isotropic materials. With the widespread use of composites and the use of metals and special metal alloys with directionality, we no longer deal exclusively with isotropic materials.
